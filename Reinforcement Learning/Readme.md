## Introduction

Stock prediction is a challenging task that involves analyzing historical data, identifying patterns, and predicting future price movements. This project focuses on using reinforcement learning algorithms to make accurate predictions and improve trading strategies.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. In the context of stock prediction, the agent learns to make trading decisions based on historical price data, with the goal of maximizing profits.

This repository provides an implementation of various reinforcement learning algorithms applied to stock market data, along with example code and pre-trained models.

## Usage

To use the implemented reinforcement learning algorithms for stock prediction, follow the steps below:

1. Prepare your dataset. See the [Dataset](#dataset) section for more information on the required data format.

2. Explore the available reinforcement learning algorithms in the repository.

3. Choose an algorithm and customize its parameters according to your requirements.

4. Train the algorithm using the provided data.

5. Evaluate the trained model's performance and make predictions.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation and example code provided in each algorithm's respective folder.


## Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository includes the following reinforcement learning algorithms for stock prediction:

- Deep Q Learning (DQN)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)

Each algorithm has its own folder containing the necessary code, documentation, and example files.

## Dataset

To train and test the reinforcement learning algorithms, you need historical stock market data in a suitable format. The dataset should include the following information:
- Timestamp: The date and time of each data point.
- Open: The opening price of the stock.
- High: The highest price reached during the period.
- Low: The lowest price reached during the period.
- Close: The closing price of the stock.
- Volume: The trading volume of the stock.

Ensure that the dataset is properly preprocessed and formatted according to the requirements of the specific algorithm you choose to use.
