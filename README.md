# Stock Prediction Using ML

This repository contains implementations of different machine learning algorithms for stock market prediction.

## Overview

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. In this repository, we explore the use of various machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices.

## Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of the following machine learning algorithms for stock market prediction:
- Linear Regression
- Supervised Learning
- Reinforced Learning
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, first clone it to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ViratSrivastava/Stock-Prediction-Using-ML.git
```
Then, navigate to the repository and install the required dependencies:
```
cd Stock-Prediction-Using-ML pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the desired algorithm with the appropriate parameters. For example, to run the linear regression algorithm with a training data file `train.csv` and a test data file `test.csv`, use the following command: 
```
python linear_regression.py --train train.csv --test test.csv
```
